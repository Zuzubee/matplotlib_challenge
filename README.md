Observations and Insights
My first observations is that of the top 2 Drug Regiments, which are Capomulin and Ramicane, Capomulin had less variabliity within its midspread. ALso of the top 4 drug regiments, Infubibnol was the only drug regiment shown to have an outlier which lies outside the lower bound.

My second observation is that the Capomulin drug was highly effective in reducing the Tumor Volume of the s185 mouse. According to my line plot below the drug was able to reduce the tumor volume by at least 50%.

My third observation is that as the weight of the mouse increases the tumor volume increases as well. This shows that there is a positive correlation between the weight and the tumor volume of the mice. The Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.84 shows that there is a high degree of correlation between these two varilables.
